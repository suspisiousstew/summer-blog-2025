            <h4>June 2nd, happy birthday!</h4>
            <p>
                It was my Sister's bithday! They are both turning eight years old since they are twins.
            </p>
            Both of their friend came, and we ate cake, had snacks like chips, and played multiple games to play
            outside. there was a sack race, pi√±ata, and an egg spoon race(i think that's what it's called).
            
            <p>
                There was also another game, but I dont know what it's called so I'll explian it. You basically have to choose a partner, tie one of each of your ankles and then work together to get to the finish line by walking in sync.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            It was sunny the whole day, perfect for the outside games and the scavenger hunt.
                they both got a lot of presents, and looked very happy about turning eight!

            <h4>June 13th, a drawing under 30 minutes</h4>
            <p>
                Finally out of my art block, and found the perfect thing to draw.
            </p>

            <p>
                I wanted to draw something hard, not too easy since i wanted to take my time on the drawing instead of
                finishing it quickly and spending many minutes serching for a new refrence photo.

            <p>
                After around a month of everyday practicing, I can finally play Sparks, by Coldplay on the guitar, while singing the lyrics!
            </p>
               
            <p>
             It took me awhile to get this right because singing while playing the guiatr is really hard for me. And the fact that I have ADHD doesn't help either, so I feel really pround of myself for this accomplishmet.
